# CAN Format Converters and Code Generation

Details to be decided but the intention is to follow the pattern used for the Simulator. To create converters and generate code that can then be consumed by data feeders. In the case of CAN there is of course an existing eco-system of OSS and this should be used where possible. SocketCAN is a natural place to start.
